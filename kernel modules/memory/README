# mknod /dev/memory c 60 0 
# insmod memory.ko

Itâ€™s also convenient to unprotect the device:
# chmod 666 /dev/memory

If everything went well, you will have a device /dev/memory to which you can write a string of characters and it will store the last one of them. You can perform the operation like this:
$ echo -n abcdef >/dev/memory

To check the content of the device you can use a simple cat:
$ cat /dev/memory

The stored character will not change until it is overwritten or the module is removed.
